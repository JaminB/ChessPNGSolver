# Chess PNG Solver

Automatically plays chess for you, using basic image recognition to determine the position on the board, and determine the next best move.

- Implemented in Python3
- Chess Engine: Stockfish

### General Disclaimer

- This program is intended for educational purposes only. It should not be used to gain an unfair competitive advantage!

- I used this project to teach myself basic techniques of image recognition, 
and because I was curious how fast a computer could evaluate a chess position given only an image.


## Usage

```
This program uses basic PNG matching to evaluate your position on the board. 
I initially tested using the very popular chess.com standard board theme on a 13.3-inch (2560 x 1600).

To add support for additional skins you will need to build PNG equivalents in both the pieces/markers/boards directories.
```

1. Size the board on your screen as large as possible. With all positions set to standard start position. 
Run board.py, and check if the position is correctly printed out (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation). Keep resizing the board until the below is displayed.

White orientation:

```
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -
```

2. Run game.py to start playing.
